        I'm Cibelle and I'm a Full Stack Javascript Developer who decided to
        make her addiction for creating mIRC scripts into a profession. I'm a
        former teacher who loves being exposed to different concepts, cultures
        and people and I found in tech a place with endless oportunities to
        pursue that.

      <Shared.Paragraph>
        I put my heart into each and every project and my top priority is
        delivering a final product that goes above and beyond client
        expectations. I'm very much interested to add more skills to my list and
        I expect to learn and be challenged in my next roles. When not coding I
        love to hike, garden and play soccer. ðŸ˜Ž
