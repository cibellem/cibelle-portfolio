        Hey, and really nice to meet you. I'm Cibelle and I'm a Full Stack Web
        Developer who decided to make her addiction for creating mIRC scripts
        into a profession. I have had the opportunity to work at a{" "}
        <a href="https://littletaller.com/">marketing agency,</a>a{" "}
        <a href="https://www.cyberdive.co/">startup</a>, and mostly recent at a
        <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/">big corporation</a>. It has
        been a fun ride and I got to work on nice projects which I am proud of.
        I am curious by nature and love being exposed to different concepts,
        cultures and people and I found in tech a place with endless
        oportunities to pursue that.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have wroked on projects with tools such as React, Node and AWS. I love
        tinkering around and I'm very much interested to add more skills to my
        list. I do expect to learn and be challenged in my next roles. I spend a
        lot of my time coding but when not doing it I I love to hike, garden and
        play soccer. ðŸ˜Ž
      </p>
