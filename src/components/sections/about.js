        Hey, and really nice to meet you. I'm Cibelle and I'm a Full Stack
        Developer who decided to make her addiction for creating mIRC(Internet
        Relay Chat client, **for th youngers) scripts into a profession. I am
        curious by nature and love being exposed to different concepts, cultures
        and people and I found in tech a place with endless oportunities to
        pursue that.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have wroked on projects with toold such as React, Node and AWS. I love
        tinkering around and I'm very much interested to add more skills to my
        list. I do expect to learn and be challenged in my next roles. I do
        spend a lot of time coding but when doing it I I love to hike, garden
        and play soccer. ðŸ˜Ž
      </p>
    </AboutWrapper>
